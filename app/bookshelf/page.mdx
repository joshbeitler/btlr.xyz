# Bookshelf

Some blurb about my reading habits and how I choose books. Maybe some stats about how many books I read in a year, or how many I've read in total.

## Currently reading

* Meditations by Marcus Aurelius
* Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville (MIT Press)

## Read this year so far

* Tao Te Ching by Lao Tzu

## Library

These are all the books I have in my library. I've read some of them, but not all of them. Books I've read will have a checkmark next to them, and possibly a link to a review.
