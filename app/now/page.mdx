# Now

## Where I work
I recently left Zonos after spending almost 10 years there are the first product manager. Currently taking a small sabbatical and finding out what's next!

## What I'm doing for fun
Outside of work, I've been enjoying listening and making to music, photography, vinyl records, and picking up reading again. I recently started a project to capture the Southwest on medium format film and create a photo book from my adventures doing so.

## What I'm learning
I'm currently teaching myself cursive to fix my handwriting from years of neglect, which has been unexpectedly fun and rewarding. I'm also exploring working on a hobby operating system project called Mirus, written in C.

## How I'm volunteering
I dedicate time to Southern Utah CodeCamp, where I have been the Chair for 4 years. This is important to me because this event provided a jumping off point for me to get into working in tech as a teenager, and now I am able to give back and give others that same opportunity.
